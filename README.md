# ldpc
github version of swift


Getting started:
1. Clone the repo to somewhere on your machine.
2. You need to set up an environment variable called LDPC which is the path to the top directory of the project. This is done to avoid installing this as a package.
3. This project needs certain packages, and you may want to do this in a seperate conda environment.
4. You can either install the packages, or, use the recepie for creating a conda environment that contains these packages. This can be done using spec-file.txt and the command: "conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt" as instructed here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
